            The story of Santa Clous originated in Turkey!

        </h1>

        St Nicholas – the historical figure behind the man we 
        know as Santa Claus – was born in Patara, <br>
        Turkey in around 300 AD. A holy man, people believe he performed 
        many miracles in his lifetime, including <br>
        saving sailors from sinking ships. Not only did tales of 
        his generosity become the basis for Santa Claus, but <br>
        St Nicholas also became one of the patron saints of 
        sailors. The name Santa Claus comes from the dutch <br>
        'Sinter Klaas', a shortened version of Sint Nikolaas. 
        Think about taking a local guide with you to learn <br>
        more about the history of the ruins here. Funnily 
        enough, even though Santa Claus isn't linked to beaches, <br>
        Patara is a coastal beach town with 16 kilometres of 
        sand. You can visit Patara Beach from Antalya. Even <br>
        with Santa Claus's origins from Turkey, the country 
        doesn't traditionally celebrate Christmas as it's a <br>
        predominantly Muslim country. Turkey enjoys a wealth 
        of its own religious festivals, the most important <br>
        one being Ramadan. <br>
