        The Grotto of St Peter outside Antioch (now known as <br>
        Antakya) is believed to have been created by Jesus' disciple Simon <br>
        Peter. This makes it the oldest place of Christian worship <br>
        in the world. You can still visit the church and see the traces <br>
        of ancient decoration today. <br>
